The test is really little and it is my FIRST TEST with this library: I
discovered it just some days ago!! If you note errors, send me.

It's composed of just six templates used with Magic and filled with some
variables , a counter in the session and two forms, one of which tested
with DFVCheck.

To install, extract in your cgi-bin dir, be sure you have apache
executing .pl files, and set the path in test.pl to the directory in
which is Test.pm library.

Then point your browser to http://localhost/cgi-bin/Test/test.pl?p=Main
All the executed procedure will be logged in /tmp/test.log (tail -f
/tmp/test.log to view it).

Just a problem: I tried to check the correctness of the email input in
'Form2' using DFVCheck, but it doesn't work.
If someone knows why, I'm here.

If you want to send me some feedback, please use the CBF mailing list.
