=head1 DESCRIPTION

This pragma is very similar to the C<Class::props> pragma: the main
difference is the underlying variable that holds the value, which is
a global scalar in the caller package instead in the class. For example:

   package BaseClass;
   use Package::props 'a_package_prop';
   use Class::props 'a_class_prop';

   package SubClass;
   our @ISA = 'BaseClass';

   # underlaying scalar for accessor 'a_package_prop' is
   # $BaseClass::a_package_prop
   # underlaying scalar for accessor 'a_class_prop' is
   # $SubClass::a_class_prop;

This might seem a subtle difference, but the possible usage in inherited classes
makes a big difference.

You can also call a package property accessor by statically using the implementing
package name (e.g. C<BaseClass->a_prop>), regardless the subclass that uses it.

See the documentation of the accessor properties in L<Class::props>
for all the details.
