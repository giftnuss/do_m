- Minor POD changes

Version 1.72
- Changed Makefile.PL version check

Version 1.71

- Substancial changes in the internal structure to allow more efficient
  object destroying: now the objects that uses OOTools get destroyed always
  when they go out of scope instead in global destruction phase
- The variable related with the accessor is not tied anymore: this allows to
  bypass the options and frees object self reference that delayed the
  destruction until the global destruction phase (i.e. when the script exits).
