OOTools Latest Versions Changes


Version 1.71
- Fixed validation for constructor arguments

Version 1.7
- Substancial changes in the internal structure to allow more efficient
  object destroying: now the objects that uses OOTools get destroyed always
  when they go out of scope instead in global destruction phase
- The variable related with the accessor is not tied anymore: this allows to
  bypass the options and frees object self reference that delayed the
  destruction until the global destruction phase (i.e. when the script exits).

Version 1.62
- Added the perl version check to the Makefile.PL
- Added the possibility to create groups by passing just the name
  as plain string instead the usual hash reference

Version 1.61
- Some POD fixes and restyling
- Fixed bug: groups default option now is working under all circumstances

Version 1.6
- Added default option for properties group accessors
