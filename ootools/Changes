OOTools Latest Versions Changes

Version 1.76
- Added add_to() method to add props and groups accessors in other packages
- Added post_process() option to props accessors
- A few minor POD changes

Version 1.75
- Constructors can now be called as instance methods
- Added the 'copy' option to create copy constructors
- Fixed a bug in the Class::constr (introduced with a patch in version 1.74)

Version 1.74
- Eliminated version check and installation feedback system
  ("phone home" opt-out) from Makefile.PL to make Randal L Schwartz happy :-)
  and sad the author :-(

Version 1.73
- Minor POD changes

Version 1.72
- Changed Makefile.PL version check

Version 1.71
- Fixed validation for constructor arguments

Version 1.7
- Substancial changes in the internal structure to allow more efficient
  object destroying: now the objects that uses OOTools get destroyed always
  when they go out of scope instead in global destruction phase
- The variable related with the accessor is not tied anymore: this allows to
  bypass the options and frees object self reference that delayed the
  destruction until the global destruction phase (i.e. when the script exits).

- Added the possibility to create groups by passing just the name
  as plain string instead the usual hash reference
