IO::Util README File
====================


Description
-----------

This is a micro-weight module that export just the 'capture' function. It executes the code inside the first argument block, and captures the output it sends to the selected file handler (or to a specific file handler). It "hijacks" all the write and print statements addressed to the captured filehandler, returning the scalar reference of the output. Sort of "print to scalar" function.
