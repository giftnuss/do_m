=head1 NAME

CGI::Builder::Conf - Add user editable configuration files to your WebApp

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use CGI::Builder
  qw| CGI::Builder::Conf
    | ;
  
  # in the instance script
  $webapp = My::WebApp->new( conf_file => '/path/to/conf_file.mml' )
  
  # optionally in the CBB
  My::WebApp->conf_options ( .... );   # IO::Util::load_mml options

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Extension adds another way to pass arguments to the new method: a user editable MML file (see L<IO::Util/"Minimal Markup Language (MML)">). This is useful when you want to give to other people (e.g. your client) the possibility to configure their own application instance, but you don't want to give them the possibility to edit and run a potentially usecure perl script.

You can do so by passing to the new method the full path to a C<conf_file>; its data will be loaded as the default arguments for that instance (see L<Class::constr/"OPTIONS">).

B<Important Note>: Please notice that the data contained in the C<conf_file> are  tainted however, so treat that with care (e.g. as they were query parameters).

=head1 PROPERTY AND GROUP ACCESSORS

=head2 conf_file

This property access and sets the full path to the MML configuration file. You will usually set it with the C<new()> method or by overriding the property.

=head2 conf_options

This is a Class property group accessor, which allows you to define the C<IO::Util::load_mml> options used to load the C<conf_file>. It has a true C<optional> option by default (i.e. it won't croak for missing C<conf_file>)

=head1 SUPPORT

See L<CGI::Builder/"SUPPORT">.
